This repository contains a Haskell code example demonstrating a subtle bug related to the Show instance for the Maybe type.  The bug manifests when dealing with recursive data structures within the Maybe type.  The `bug.hs` file shows the buggy implementation, while `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version.  The core issue is improper handling of precedence and recursion depth in the Show instance definition leading to stack overflow errors when printing recursive Maybe values. The solution uses a more robust approach to prevent infinite recursion.
